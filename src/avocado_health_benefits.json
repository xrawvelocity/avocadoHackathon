    "Benefit": "Avocado Has Been Shown to Decrease Belly Fat",
    "Description": "Do a little belly dance! Make a little lunch! And get down on avocado oil. Researchers say swapping your cooking and finishing oils for varieties like avocado oil that are rich in monounsaturated and oleic fatty acids can spot reduce abdominal fat, which may decrease the risk for metabolic syndrome\u2014the name for a combination of negative health markers associated with weight gain. A recent Penn State study found people who consumed 40 grams (about 3 tablespoons) of high-oleic oils on a daily basis for four weeks lowered their belly fat by 1.6 percent compared to those who consumed a flax/safflower oil blend, which is comparatively high in polyunsaturated fat.\n\nA second study in the journal Diabetes Care found similar results: A diet rich in monounsaturated fat may actually prevent body fat distribution around the belly by down-regulating the expression of certain fat genes.\n\nOne tablespoon of mild and slightly nutty-tasting avocado oil is about 120 calories and 10 grams of monounsaturated fat\u2014a nutritional profile almost identical to extra virgin olive oil. But unlike EVOO, avocado oil has a very high smoke point, so you can use it for saut\u00e9s and stir-frys without risk of creating free radicals that can harm your health."

    "Benefit": "Avocados Are Good Appetite Suppressants",
    "Description": "A scoop of guacamole may be one of the most effective hunger-squashers known to man. In a study published in Nutrition Journal, participants who ate half a fresh avocado with lunch reported a 40 percent decreased desire to eat for hours afterward. At only 60 calories, a two-tablespoon serving of guacamole (on top of eggs, salads, grilled meats, etc.) can provide the same satiety benefit with even more of a flavor punch.\n\nJust 86 the chips and be sure when buying store-bought guac that avocados actually made it into the jar. Believe it or not, many store-bought brands make guacamole without the real fruit! We love Wholly Guacamole as a store brand, and they've just released perfectly portioned \"minis\" so you don't have to worry about going overboard."

    "Benefit": "Avocados May Help Improve Overall Diet Quality",
    "Description": "You know that friend who's always thinner, lighter and healthier than you? What's their secret? Not money, not genes \u2026 just regular consumption of avocado, according to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a program of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nThe survey results, published in Nutrition Journal, found that eating half a medium-sized avocado on a daily basis was highly correlated with improved overall diet quality and a 50 percent reduced risk of metabolic syndrome.\n\nNot only did the avocado eaters report a lower body mass index and smaller waist circumference, but they also consumed significantly more fruits and vegetables, and fiber and vitamin K\u2014nutrients associated with weight loss. Avocado: the gateway drug to a healthier, leaner lifestyle."

    "Benefit": "Avocado Helps You Absorb More Nutrients",
    "Description": "Low-calorie, vitamin-rich and chock-full of important nutrients that can shrink your waist, vegetables are a dieter's best friend; but you won't get much benefit from a garden salad without adding a little fat, researchers say.\n\nAnd when it comes to fat, the type found in avocados reigns supreme. In one study, published in the journal Molecular Nutrition & Food Research, researchers fed participants salads topped with saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fat-based dressings and tested their blood for absorption of fat-soluble carotenoids\u2014disease-fighting compounds associated with improved weight and fat loss.\n\nThe result? Veggies topped with monounsaturated fat required the least amount\u2014just 3 grams\u2014to get the most carotenoid absorption, while saturated fat and polyunsaturated fat dressings required higher amounts of fat (20 grams) to get the same benefit.\n\nAnother study in the Journal of Nutrition found that adding avocado to salad allowed participants to absorb three to five times more carotenoids. Give your greens the ultimate nutrient boost with a dollop of flavorful guacamole, a few slices of fresh avocado, or a tablespoon of avocado oil-based vinaigrette. Those dressing-on-the-side folks don't know what they're missing. But speaking of salad dressings, make sure you steer clear of these worst salad dressings!"

    "Benefit": "Avocado May Lower 'Bad' Cholesterol Levels",
    "Description": "Apples are so cliche. Researchers now say it's an avocado a day that can really keep the doctor\u2014and your cholesterol levels\u2014at bay. One study in the Journal of the American Heart Association put 45 overweight people on one of three different cholesterol-lowering diets for five weeks. One diet was lower in fat, with 24 percent of total calories coming from mostly saturated fat, and didn't include an avocado. A second non-avocado diet was more moderate in fat, with 34 percent of total calories coming from mostly saturated fats. The third was equally moderate in fat, at 34 percent, but replaced some of the saturated fats with one whole Haas avocado per day.\n\nThe result? Low-density lipoprotein (LDL), the \"bad\" cholesterol, was 13.5 mg/dL lower among the avocado dieters than the low-fat group\u2014enough to significantly reduce the risk of heart disease. Researchers attribute the results to avocado's monounsaturated fat content (a type of heart-healthy fat molecule that has one unsaturated carbon bond), which may play an important part in lowering elevated cholesterol\u2014a factor in insulin resistance, excess weight, and obesity. So grab a spoon, a sprinkling of kosher salt or spice if you so wish, and get snacking."

    "Benefit": "Avocado Antioxidants Neutralize DNA-Damaging Free Radicals",
    "Description": "There's a war going on inside your body! The free radicals have launched an attack on the mitochondria and it's sabotaging your metabolism! What the what? Free radicals are destructive rogue oxygen molecules\u2014natural byproducts of metabolism\u2014that trigger various chain reactions in the body that destroy cells and DNA, causing all kinds of health problems.\n\nAntioxidants in fresh fruits and vegetables can help neutralize some free radicals, but they can't reach the mitochondria\u2014base camp for the free radical army. And that's a problem; when your mitochondria aren't working properly, your metabolism runs less efficiently. Enter: Avocado.\n\nResearchers say the results jive with low disease rates in Mediterranean countries where olive oil\u2014nutritionally similar to the avocado\u2014is a diet staple.\n\nIn fact, study authors predict avocado oil could eventually be referred to as \"the olive oil of the Americas.\" So put down the white flag and pick up a green fruit; it's good for your metabolism and patriotic to boot."

    "Benefit": "Avocadoes May Help Decrease Risk of Diabetes",
    "Description": "Sure, avocado's got all the right junk in all the right places, but fat isn't the only thing the fruit has going for it. Avocado also provides nearly 20 vitamins, minerals, and phytonutrients essential for healthy weight management, including 14 grams of satiating fiber and 66 percent (60 micrograms) of your daily need for vitamin K\u2014a nutrient that helps regulate sugar metabolism and insulin sensitivity.\n\nOne study in the journal Diabetes Care found men and women whose vitamin K intake was among the highest 25 percent of subjects showed a 19 percent lower risk of developing diabetes over the course of 10 years compared with those whose intake was among the lowest fourth.\n\nLeafy greens are an even richer source of the vitamin, so pair a wedge of creamy avocado with your side salad and you're bound to get your fill. Stabilizing blood sugar has never been so tasty."

    "Benefit": "Avocados Boost Metabolism and Exercise Endurance",
    "Description": "Pre-workout supplements claim to give you that extra boost you need to sweat it out for just a little longer than usual. According to researchers, eating avocado can provide the same energy boost, naturally. A study in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition compared the effects of a three-week diet high in palmitic acid (saturated fat) to an equicaloric diet high in oleic acid (monounsaturated fats).\n\nThe subjects followed each diet for three weeks at a time, during which researchers assessed physical activity and metabolic rate after eating.\n\nThe results? Physical activity was 13.5 percent higher during the high oleic acid diet and post-meal metabolism was 4.5 percent higher as compared to the palmitic stretch.\n\nBottom line: swap fried foods, baked goods, and butter for snacks and oils that are high in monounsaturated fat like fresh avocado or avocado oil for a clean energy boost that keeps your metabolism burning, even after you've left the gym."
